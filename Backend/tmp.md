Okay, I've reviewed your code snippet:

```javascript
function sum() { return a+b ;}
```

Here's what I've found and some suggestions:

**Issues:**

*   **`a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope:**  The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b`, but these variables are not defined as parameters to the function or declared within the function's body. This means the function will likely rely on variables `a` and `b` being defined in the *outer* scope (global scope, or some enclosing function's scope).  This is generally bad practice.  It makes the function's behavior unpredictable and dependent on where it's called.  If `a` and `b` are not defined in the outer scope, you'll get a `ReferenceError`.
*   **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is intended to add two numbers. It should accept those numbers as parameters.

**Suggestions:**

1.  **Define Parameters:**  The best and most common approach is to pass the numbers you want to add as *arguments* to the function, and define *parameters* to receive those arguments.

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    
    // Example usage:
    let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
    console.log(result);
    ```

2.  **Consider Default Parameters (if appropriate):** If you want the function to have default values for `a` and `b` if they're not provided when the function is called, you can use default parameters:

    ```javascript
    function sum(a = 0, b = 0) {
      return a + b;
    }

    console.log(sum());      // Output: 0 (a=0, b=0)
    console.log(sum(5));   // Output: 5 (a=5, b=0)
    console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8 (a=5, b=3)
    ```

3.  **If `a` and `b` *must* come from an outer scope (rare case):** If you *absolutely* need to use `a` and `b` from an outer scope (e.g., because another function is setting them up), make sure they are clearly defined *before* you call `sum()`.  However, strive to avoid this approach whenever possible!

    ```javascript
    let a = 10;
    let b = 20;

    function sum() {
      return a + b;
    }

    console.log(sum()); // Output: 30
    ```

**Why are parameters important?**

*   **Clarity:**  Parameters make the function's purpose and dependencies clear.  You can immediately see what the function needs to work.
*   **Reusability:**  A function with parameters can be used in many different contexts with different input values.  A function that relies on global variables is much harder to reuse.
*   **Testability:**  Functions with parameters are much easier to test because you can directly control the input values.
*   **Avoiding Side Effects:**  Relying on global variables can lead to unintended side effects in other parts of your code.  Parameters help isolate the function's behavior.

**In summary:**  The first suggestion (using parameters) is almost always the best solution.  It creates a clean, predictable, and reusable function. Only use the "outer scope" approach if you have a very specific reason and understand the potential drawbacks.
